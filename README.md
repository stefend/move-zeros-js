# move-zeros-js

Here's my solution to Cassidy William's newsletter she sent out April 18th, 2021. It involves moving zeros in an array while retaining the order of the other elements of the array.

Simple manual testing shows it's working. Feel free to make pull requests to show where I could make improvements!
